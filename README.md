# GP2Y0D8xxZ0F
A board designed with KiCAD for SHARP sensor GP2Y0D805Z0F, GP2Y0D810Z0F and GP2Y0D815Z0F

I had bought some 'of these sensors with a friend, without taking them with boards that are easily found on the online store, because we had the need for stable fixing points, that these models did not guarantee.
Then we decided to create a board to "normal" components, but on the way, thanks to some of KiCAD libraries and others that I have modified, I have designed the board so it could also be assembled with SMD components.
